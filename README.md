# SecureConnect - ByteSeekers

Welcome to **SecureConnect**, a secure and user-friendly authentication system developed by **ByteSeekers** (Hiranya Semindi, Virul Nirmala, Tilakna Gunawardhane, Udeepa Gaallage). This project is part of the **SpiritX 2025** hackathon and is built using **Firebase Authentication** to provide a seamless and secure signup and login experience.

## Project Overview

SecureConnect is a secure authentication system that allows users to:
- **Sign up** with a unique username and strong password.
- **Log in** and be greeted with a personalized message.

The project is built using **React** for the frontend and **Firebase** for authentication and backend services. The system enforces validation rules, manages errors effectively, and provides a polished user experience.
